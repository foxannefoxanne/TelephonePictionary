    <string name="normal_instr">Telephonary is based off a combination of two popular games: Telephone and Pictionary. \nIn Telephonary the first player types a phrase and passes to the next player, who will look at the phrase and attempt to draw it. That player will then pass to the next player, who, only looking at the drawing, will attempt to guess the original phrase. \nThis will continue, alternating between drawing a picture from the phrase and writing a phrase from the picture.\nEnjoy the confusion!</string>
    <string name="pass_play">Pass And Play Version</string>
    <string name="pass_play_instr">Start the new game using the Pass and Play button. Select the number of players. The first player will type a phrase, then select the Pass button. The player will then pass the device onto the next player. This player will draw a picture depicting the phrase and pass it on. \nPlay will continue alternating between the player typing a phrase from the picture and the player drawing a picture from a phrase until the device has traveled to all players.</string>
